# Here we will calculate totals by occasion, user, and day.
# This will be useful if a researcher wants to look at the sum of each eating occasion 
# per participant. In contrast, the totals file we generated summed all the occasions of 
# a certain day into one datapoint.

# Generate sum of foods consumed by each user, by day, and by occasion.  
# Output will be saved as: Items_by_User_Occ.  
  SumByOccasion(items.data=items_f_id_s_m_QCed, User.Name='UserName', 
                Recall.No='RecallNo',   Occ.No='Occ_No')
  
# Take a look at the first 10 rows of the first 6 columns.
# Items are summed by occasion number for each participant's RecallNo. 
  Items_by_User_Occ[1:10, 1:6]

# The Items_by_User_Occ function adds occasion names (breakfast, snacks etc.) to items.data.
# Output will be saved as: Sum_by_User_Day_Occ.

              Recall.No='RecallNo', Occ.No='Occ_No', Occ.Name='Occ_Name')

# The output Sum_by_User_Day_Occ has the sum of foods consumed by each user, day, and occasion,
# with occasion names in words.
  
# Take a look at the first 6 rows. Spelled-out occasion names corresponding to occasion name 
# have been added at the end.

# This will be useful if a researcher wants to look at the sum of each eating occasion 
# per participant. (Because Totals file sums all the occasions as one day)
