# Generate foodtree out of GLU - males in their 60-79, with 55 subsamples of Prediabetic.

# ===============================================================================================================

# In this script, we will build a foodtree with the NHANES 2-day average totals, subsetted for males, 
# 60-79 years old. 

# First, we will load the QC-ed averaged totals of males 60-79 years old (n=236) and all food records (n=4,164). 
# Then, we will keep the food records of only the individuals in males 60-79 years old and generate a foodtree
# with the filtered food data.
