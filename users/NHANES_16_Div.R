# Dietary diversity may have an important role in predicting health outcomes, and nuts/seeds/legumes food 
# groups are likely to have health-promoting effects. To investigate the dietary diversity in specific food
# groups, we will select food items in a particular group, evaluate their diversity, and group participants
# based on their consumption patterns of the food group of interest.
