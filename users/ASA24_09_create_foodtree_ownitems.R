# Generate a foodtree from ASA24 data without using FilterDBByDiet, a clean version.
# Version 2
# Created on 02/16/2023 by Rie Sadohara
# 06/26/2023 replaced "OTU" with "IFC".
# ===============================================================================================================

# This brief script is to serve as an example of generating foodtrees and IFC tables with your own dataset. 
# IFC tables contain participants and food items, showing the consumption amount of each food item by each 
# participant. IFC tables also contain the taxonomy (food group information) for each food items and will be 
# used in ordination (grouping) analyses.

# This script demonstrates how to:
# 1. Build a foodtree with food items reported by VVKAJ study participants.
# 2. Generate IFC tables from the taxonomy information of reported food items.

# As explained in the previous script, the functions in Food_tree_scripts folder expects that the input files are 
# tab-delimited txt file with no special characters that impede correct loading such as:
#   "
#   '
#   #
#   &

# The use of the FormatFoods function in 02_load_clean_ASA24.R script has already dealt with special characters in 
# the VVKAJ items data, but it is helpful to know the assumptions which the functions you are going to use were built on.

# Before proceeding, create a new folder called "Foodtree" in the "VVKAJ" folder, in which you will save the output.
