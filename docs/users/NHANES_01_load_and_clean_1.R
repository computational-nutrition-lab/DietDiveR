# In this tutorial, we aim to demonstrate the utility of the DietDiveR package by applying it to the dietary data 
# available from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 

# NHANES is a national survey conducted with some thousands of participants across the US over two days. NHANES 
# data is published every other year and consists of various kinds of data including dietary intake, body 
# measurements, laboratory-taken data. There are numerous questions that can be asked with these data to 
# connect dietary intake with various biomarkers. Here, as an example, we will explore the dietary intake
# (food items) of participants and look at the relationship between dietary patterns and diabetic status in 
# NHANES 2015-2016.

# Refer to the NHANES data and documentation (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx) for more information 
# about each release (version) of NHANES and the variables measured.

# Sample weight is an important tool to use if you aim for population-level estimates because the composition of 
# demographics of NHANES participants differ slightly from that of the actual US population (i.e., certain demographic
# subgroups were oversampled). Weights are applied to adjust NHANES data to reflect the proportions of demographic 
# subgroups in the actual population. However, this part is omitted in this tutorial as our main goal here is to 
# demonstrate how to analyze NHANES data as is, not to make population-wise inferences.  For more detailed information,
# please refer to the sample weight tutorial by NHANES (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/Weighting.aspx). 

# Data from NHANES are in .XPT format, and you will need a specific R package, SASxport, to import it into R. 
# We will download the example data files from the NHANES 2015-2016 page 
# (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2015) 
# and save them in the "Raw_data" folder in the "NHANES" folder.

# Open "NHANES_01_load_and_clean_1.R" script (this script) in the "users" folder and load the packages 
# needed as per the directions.

# In this tutorial, you will learn how to download datasets and associated other databases from NHANES, 
# how to process that data with DietDiveR, and the food tree to generate dietary patterns, and how to integrate these 
# dietary patterns with other biomarker data from NHANES to explore specific hypotheses.

# Load and prepare Food Patterns Equivalent Database for use
  
# The Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) has the composition of nutrients and food categories of

# (https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/docs/fped-databases/)

# You need to use the version of FPED that corresponds with the NHANES version that you explore. When using NHANES,
# you will need to use the FPED with the same release year as the year of NHANES you are analyzing. 
# For this tutorial, FPED was downloaded from NHANES the FPED table is formatted by renaming the variables with
# R-loadable ones (e.g., "F_CITMLB (cup eq.)" -> "F_CITMLB" and saved as "FPED_1516_forR.txt".

# Food data can be downloaded from the NHANES website. For each cycle of NHANES there are two days of dietary 
# records available for many participants. The food-level data is available for each of these days of 
# dietary records. These are stored separately as Day 1 and Day 2. Here we will download both days and 
# combine them to obtain better estimates of diet.

  # Download day 1 data.

# [NOTE] Different alphabets are used on the variables' names in different release of NHANES 
# data.  Therefore, you will need to change the alphabet (and potentially the other parts of the 
# variable names) in order to run this script with other releases of NHANES. For example, 
# DR1IFDCD is a column name for the food code used in the NHANES 2015-2016, and the 
# alphabet for this release is "I". The alphabet for NHANES 2017-2018 is "J", so the food code 
# column in that dataset is DR1JFDCD, and the other columns in it have DR1J or DR2J as prefixes.  

# Whilst we will only use one dataset (2015-16) in this tutorial, you may want to combine several releases to 
# analyze long-term trends. It is recommended that you check the variable names and food item names as the food 
# databases are updated regularly, and they may not perfectly match across versions.
