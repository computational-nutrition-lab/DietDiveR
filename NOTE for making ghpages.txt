users/NHANES_01_load_and_clean_1.R

- deleted SASxport. 
- deleted load foreign.
- other operations are the same!
- the functions in the lib folder uses "foreign" package, not 
SASxport package, actually.. so no edits are needed for lib/load_clean_NHANES.R.


NHANES_03
# Check the number of participants in the QCtotals - should be 4,164 people. <--- change 4614 to 4164!!!!!
  length(unique(QCtotal_d$SEQN))

Check the number of rows - should have 1,943 rows. <--- change 1943 to 1923!!!!!

nrow(QCtotal_d_ga_body_meta_glu_comp)
## [1] 1923


NHANES_08
# It should have 236 individuals (rows) and 266 variables (columns).
  dim(totals_males60to79) <--- not 237. But the website has already 236, so may not have to be changed.
